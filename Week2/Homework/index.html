          <div class= "col col-sm-4 col-md bg-danger"> Return to a world of charming horror in Little Nightmares II, a suspense adventure game in which you play as Mono, a young boy trapped in a world that has been distorted by the humming transmission of a distant tower.

		With Six, the girl in the yellow raincoat, as his guide, Mono sets out to discover the dark secrets of The Signal Tower. Their journey won't be easy; Mono and Six will face a host of new threats from the terrible residents of this world.

		Will you dare to face this collection of new, little nightmares? </div>

		Like its predecessors, Little Nightmares II is a puzzle-platformer adventure game. The player takes control of a boy named Mono, who, along with Six (the protagonist of the first game who returns as a companion non-playable character), journeys through the Pale City to reach the Signal Tower.

Like Six, Mono is not limited in actions. However, unlike Six in the first game, he has the ability to use any long objects as tools to break objects or obstacles, or as weapons to fight small enemies.

          <div class= "col col-sm-4 col-md bg-warning">
		  Instead of a lighter, Mono uses a flashlight, which at some point can be used to immobilize certain enemies like the Patients. Additionally, Mono does not travel alone and is aided by Six as a companion. As such both Mono and Six must work together to accomplish various tasks and puzzles that cannot be done alone.

Mono also has the ability to use televisions as portals to navigate the Pale City. Mono is also able to find television remote and use it to activate or deactivate a television.
